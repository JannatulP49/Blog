 DEBUGGING BLOG 

Debugging is usually defined as the process of finding and fixing errors or bugs in the source code of any software. Debugging ensure that your code runs properly with out any mistakes, different programming languages have various debugging methods due to the difference in structure of the language models. Specifically we will be going into the process of debugging in python.

The debugging process in Python code consists of identifying, analyzing, and then resolving the errors in your code. This is a crutial part of being a programmer making sure the quality and reliablilty of the code is accurate. There are various error types such as, Syntax Errors, Runtime Errors, and Logical Errors. Identifying the type of error could be confusing but there are various things that you can look out for in your code to identify the type of error. Syntax error is an error that consists of violations of Python's grammar rules, preventing code execution. On the other hand, Runtime errors are problems encountered during the programs execution, even with correct syntax. Lastly, Logical erros are the most challenging to identify, its when the code runs without errors but produces incorrect or unexpected results. 

Then after identifying the error, you have to analyze it to define what specific type of error it is, once that is done, now
